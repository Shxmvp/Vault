stream of conciousness
at least i'm concious? what do I want ? im always asking myself, i guess if im trying to start small i'd say I want to ive already been distracted from this in struggling to start small. i was lost in thoughts of wanting to be comfortable enough to not hate starting my day brushing my teeth and having a shower and dragging it out until the whole day is gone, and then I never started my day. soon enough i hope. I guess I should start waking up and having a shower, despite said shower, i dont like the feeling of having to do something but i also hate the feeling of wasting time. The feeling is a dull yet anxious vapour that stuffs my chest and my sinuses, and is only lessened by beating it out. Today we are going to get piercings at woolwich, and I can go into savers but not wilko. Wilkinsons was destroyed, as with the remaining block of flats, to make room for a new liesure centre. That is what is needed in the housing crisis but ok.
